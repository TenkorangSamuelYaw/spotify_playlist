This is a python project to create a Spotify Playlist using the Musical Time Machine.
The Musical Time Machine is generated by accepting a particular date from the user and combining it with the URL(https://www.billboard.com/) of billboard and passing it as a GET request using the request module in python
The response of the GET request which is a website is scrapped using Beautiful soup (bs4).
Using the CSS selector method select(), appropriate selectors are passed and the song titles elements for all the 100 songs are retrieved.
The song titles are retrieved using the getText() method.
The OAuth required by Spotify from 3rd party applications (like this project) is generated using the SpotifyOAuth() class from the spotipy.oauth2 library by passing the required arguments.
The required arguments are; SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI, USERNAME(your spotify username), scope="playlist-modify-private", cache_path="token.txt"
The generated OAuth is passed to the spotipy.Spotify() class and a playlist object is created from the spotipy library.
The user-id is stored from the playlist object, using current_user() method and adding the key: "id"  from the playlist object.
This user-id will be used to represent the user in methods that require it.
The user_playlist_create() method of the playlist object is used to create a new private playlist.
Finally, all the 100 songs from the selected date are added to the private playlist using the playlist_add_items() method from the playlist object.
